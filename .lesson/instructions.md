# Instructions  

 I've given you an array of different chess pieces. There is a pawn, a knight, a bishop, and rook, a queen, and a king.

 Write a function that will sort through the array and put the pieces on different 'shelves' in the DOM.

 You should use a for-loop, a conditional statement, and the textContent property.

 1. Pawns go on the pawn shelf.
 2. Knights and bishops go on the minor pieces shelf.
 3. Rooks go on the rook shelf.
 4. The queen and king go on the royal shelf.
